Hariharan

- Wrote functions to parse data files, check precision, recall, f_scores.
- Used K-NN classifier on the entire dataset and for distinguishing between Dynamic and Non-Dynamic activities. 
- Mean F-score of 99% was recorded for distinguishing dynamic and non-dynamic activities



Keerthi

- Tested SVM Linear and RBF functions classifiers for full dataset and dynamic-nondynamic datasets as well
- SVM Linear gave better performance than RBF for full dataset
- SVM Linear gave 100% performance for dynamic-nondynamic classification problem 
 
 Nitin

 -Tested LDA classifier with full dataset and dynamic-nondynamic datasets as well
 -Much better gains seen in performance when LDA classifier uses dynamic and nondynamic dataset.
 - LDA gives 100% performance on Dynamic dataset
